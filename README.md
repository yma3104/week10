1. Alphabate Teaching
I'll animate the alphabate chart. And then give some pictures of some simple objects. When spell all the words correct. it will continue to the next object.
I'll complete all the animations by TVpaint (2D animation software) and upload into P5.

Ill use Adobe Maya(3d modeling sofetware) to make a modle and export to obj file.
